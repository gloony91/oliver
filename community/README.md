=========

there might be a time where you just want a ton
of random iOS projects, or something.

maybe you don't want to write out a long list of repos.
thank the heavens for the community(!)

hopefully people will start submitting their `.Olivefile`s
and we can all collaborate and stuff. it (might) be cool :)

if you want to be a part of this, just fork Oliver and add your
Olivefile into this directory. name your Olivefile the category of
what your Olivefile is for-what your GitHub username is.yml.
for example, `ruby-projects-trommel.yml`
